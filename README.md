# Alex Milton Portfolio

A portfolio website built using html, SCSS, and a little JavaScript. The porfolio includes some bits about me as well as a list of the tech stacks and skills I know and some projects that I have worked on. Finally it also includes links to my GitHub, linkedIn and my email address in the contact me section.
